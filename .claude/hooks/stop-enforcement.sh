[Check ALL hook outputs above. (1) ASSUMPTIONS (R093 + R095): Scan your LAST response for claims ABOUT THIS SYSTEM — Smart AI code, DB schema, tables, columns, routes, workflow engine, agent architecture, repo files, or commits/files in this repo. If any such claim was NOT verified by a fresh tool call in THIS session or by evidence already shown earlier in THIS transcript, say 'I stated [X] without verifying — let me check' and READ the actual code/data before continuing. R095 rule: do NOT stuff file paths, line numbers, or table.column syntax into the visible reply — verification is INTERNAL; user-facing text stays plain English unless Antonio asks for the citation. Claims about EXTERNAL services (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, OpenAI, third-party APIs, general AI-ecosystem facts), ordinary reasoning, proposals, and questions to the user are OUT OF SCOPE and do NOT require citation. Evidence cited earlier in the same session counts as citation; do NOT demand re-citation. Do NOT cycle: if the last response already addressed the prior hook feedback, accept it and move on. (2) SAVE: If SAVE_NEEDED=true, update Smart AI dev_task 2bc839aa via Management API curl to tapbgvbglqacamhayfel. (3) QA: If 'QA REQUIRED' appeared, test in Chrome before declaring done.]
